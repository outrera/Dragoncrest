An action-y type of game with a style largely inspired after the original GameBoy, this game will tell the story of a knight whose rite of passage turns into a journey across several kingdoms.

**Important Note** : I've had a few concerns as of recent, and as such have decided to move development over to a private repo. When it's done or at least partially complete, I will make an effort to update this repository so it would include the code portion of the game under an MIT license. I will also look into separating some bits of the game into their own repositories, to serve as useful additions to anyone working on their game. Thanks for chaning this out, hope to keep you updated soon.
